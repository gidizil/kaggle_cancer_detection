# TODO:
1. plot loss function of training (pay attention to GPU mode) - DONE
2. fix the ssh linux no matplotlib - DONE
2. create a train_and_eval method in Classifier. - New branch - DONE
3. plot train/val from the train and eval method - DONE
4. Use other metrices other than loss ( accuracy, precision, recall) etc. Create/Find metrics class
5. visualize batch before network
6. learn work with .git ignore. move config, and all other text data
7. Fix README.md - Its important
8. init final layer according to label distribution
9. Make GPU and CPU config - PATHS- DONE
10. Split to train and val on gpu - DONE
11. invest time in transformations and augmentations
12. And support for hyper-parameters
13. Understand pytorch basic weight initiliaztion - Understand - just uniform with mean zero - Done
14. Visualize results on distinct set during training (use probas and labels). - See how the identification occurs
15. tensorboard support - wait for a more stable version with more tutorials
16. Data centering - Mean 0 in each channel
17. Plot the change in weights and biases through training epochs (plot average and relative)
18. improve plotting capabilities - pass information with net and training to add to the plot
19. Handle hyper_params and and pre_proc_params in different dictionaries
