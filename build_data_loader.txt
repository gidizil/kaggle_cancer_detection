building a data loader:

Two big steps (classes):
1. Pickle data
2. build loader

step 1:
final goal: 
build dict with {'desc': description of pickle file,
				 'labels': list of lables,
				 'data': np array of the data: perhaps flattened}
				 'filenames': list with name of files
labels, data, and filenames are the size of the pickle size
